Midway upon the journey of our life\n
I found myself within a forest dark,\n
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.\n
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say\n
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,\n
Which in the very thought renews the fear.\n
So bitter is it, death is little more;\n
But of the good to treat, which there I found,\n
Speak will I of the other things I saw there.\n
I cannot well repeat how there I entered,\n
So full was I of slumber at the moment\n
In which I had abandoned the true way.\n
But after I had reached a mountain\'s foot,\n
At that point where the valley terminated,\n
Which had with consternation pierced my heart,\n
Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,\n
Vested already with that planet\'s rays\n
Which leadeth others right by every road.
